The list will be returned in readable String format or in JSON for use with other applications.

## Rules
* A person cannot be their own Secret Santa
* A person can only be the same other person’s Secret Santa once every three years (​​e.g. if in 2020 Martin was Julia's Secret Santa, Martin cannot again be  Julia's Secret Santa before 2023)
* Each person will be assigned to one Secret Santa
